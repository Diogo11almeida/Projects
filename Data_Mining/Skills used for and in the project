including the use of graphics, both to present and analyze
data;

and pre-processing tasks (e.g. detect outliers or dealing
with missing values);

Describe and use Multidimensional Visualization Methods,
such as such as principal components analysis, t-SNE,
UMAP and Self-Organizing Maps;

Describe with detail clustering techniques such as
hierarchical clustering, partitioning methods (k-means and
medoids), and fuzzy clustering;

Describe with detail density-based clustering techniques
such as DBSCAN and Mean-Shift;

Understanding the trade-offs involved in the definition of the
number of clusters and how to interpret and analyze a
clustering solution; 

Discuss the use of nearest neighbors and decision trees to
explore and get insights on clustering solutions;

Create a segmentation, being able to explain the options
used and explaining alternative approaches, whenever
available.
